# openSUSE Settings

This is my openSUSE Linux configuration with all my installed apps and how to configure them. Here I also keep track of what commands and system files I run or edit that change how my environment functions.


All my app settings can be found in the `docs` folder. When something references a config file to copy somewhere, it is most likely referencing a file in `configs`.

All scripts in `bin` are a work in progress to one day streamline the installation process and automate app configuration.
