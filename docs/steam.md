# Steam

Run the following to install Steam and other utilities:

```
sudo dnf install steam gamescope xdotool -y
sudo cp /usr/share/applications/steam.desktop .local/share/applications/
sudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.local/share/applications/steam.desktop
```

Remove all Steam, Proton, and game shortcuts from `~/.local/share/applications/` and use the GNOME extension Custom Command Toggle combined with my Bash scripts to launch Steam using Gamescope. Info on how to set this up is in my `gnome-extensions.md`.
