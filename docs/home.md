# Home

Run the following from your home directory to create new Home folders:

```
mkdir Bin Desktop System Games Inbox Syncthing Repos
```

Open Nautilus, and drag `System`, `Syncthing`, `Repos`, `Inbox`, `Games`, and `Desktop` to the left sidebar in this order to create bookmarks.

If you would like to rename the folders inside your home directory, edit `~/.config/user-dirs.dirs` and `/etc/xdg/user-dirs.conf`. Log out and back in, then remove the old Home folders. Also, remove old Home folders from Nautilus's bookmarks.
